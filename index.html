                                This is my 1978 Guild B-301. I play this bass exclusively in my band Path of Might.
                                I just used it to record all of the bass tracks on our new album last week in Nashville.
                                I bought it in 2012 on eBay after I saw the bassist of Kowloon Walled City using one.
                                This model usually comes with a single soapbar-style pickup,
                                but the previous owner routed out the body for an additional bridge position pickup.
                                I had 2 Lace Man O' War jazz pickups installed, because I deserve nice things.
                                I love the body shape. It has a natural mahogany finish and a set neck.
                                The bridge is enormous. I had the bass intonated years ago, and it still sounds great, even in drop B tuning.

                                This is my 1980 Peavey T-40 with toaster-style pickups. I just got this bass in February, 2017.
                                These basses have become popular in recent years for their price point and durability.
                                I saw my local Guitar Center had one in stock for a reasonable price with the original hard case.
                                In addition to that, it has an uncommon sienna burst finnish and a maple fretboard.
                                I was hoping to obtain a bass with a maple fretboard, since all of my other basses have rosewood fretboards.
                                It has some odd fret buzz, but I've set it up myself for drop C tuning,
                                and I've been jamming it on some death metal with my buddies Sean and Erik.

                                This is my 1988 Peavey Fury.
                                In 2015 I was obsessed with finding an affordable bass that could fit split-coil precision-style pickups,
                                    because I got a great deal on Lace Man O' War P-sensors.
                                However, I was not interested in a Fender P-bass, so I looked for other options, and found these Fury basses.
                                I checked the internet almost all of that year for a Fury in color I liked.
                                Essentially, these models are uncommon if they have black hardware and a rosewood.
                                This red one came up for a great price, so I didn't not buy it.
                                This is the only bass I keep in standard tuning, and I've been jamming it on some melodic indie rock stuff with my buddies Ray and Kaleb.

                                This is my one-of-a-kind First Act Custom Shop Delgada.
                                It literally used to belong to Avril Lavigne's bassist Al Berry.
                                First Act usually makes cheap out-of-the-box guitars, but their custom shop made instruments to order for several metal bands I like.
                                I played the hell out of this bass in my bands Cathedral Fever and White Fire when they were together.
                                The body shape is modelled after the after the Gibson RD Artist bass.
                                It has an alder body, Kent Armstrong humbuckers, and a push/pull pot on the tone knob for series/parallel pickup configurations.
                                It also has Hipshot hardware, including a drop tuner on the E string.
                                I believe the bassist of the band Doomriders gave it its original pink finish, as he was employed at the custom shop.

                            This is a bass I had constructed from various parts. Most modern basses have a 34" scale length.
                            I wanted a short 30" scale P-bass, but short scale P-basses are very uncommon, so I set about making one.
                            This one has an SX Ursa Jr. body, a short scale Squier Jaguar neck, Hipshot Ultralite tuners, and black hardware.
                            The P/J pickups were custom made by Instrumental Pickups.
                            I asked for them to sound weird, grindy, and hot. They sound weird, grindy, and hot.
                            This bass is light, fun to play, and easy to shred on because it's almost the size of a guitar.

                                Traynor is a Canadian company that used to make amps solid enough to survive a 2-story fall.
                                This one is from the 70's; hence, it is indeed robust.
                                I started looking for a YBA-3 when I saw Cancer Bats' bassist using one.
                                The YBA-3 is a 130-ish watt amp, but someone modified this one with KT88 tubes, so now it's more like 200 watts.
                                It's loud, and it's probably the best sounding amp I've ever played.
                                I literally just got it, so I'm going to do outrageous things with it.

                                Peavey used to make some well-voiced solid state amps in the 70's and 80's, before they started manufacturing overseas.
                                Death From Above 1979's bassist explicitly stated that this powerful, rare Super Festival amp is the key to his unique overdriven tone.
                                When I found this one, I didn't realize there were 2 versions of the F800-B; one with that unique overdrive, and a later version with a smoother overdrive.
                                I have the later version, so I don't actually sound like Death From Above when I play it.
                                Regardless, it's an excellent amp with a lot of clean power.
                                It's super loud (meant for festivals, go figure), and since it's solid state rather than tube, it's not so fragile that I have to worry about it crapping out on me.

                                This is a very beastly and uncommon solid state Peavey amp from the 80's.
                                It is the heaviest amp I own, around 85 lbs.
                                You can do a lot of different things with it,
                                notably run your high and low frequencies to 2 separate cabinets at 400W each from the 2 separate power sections.
                                I can easily drown out the rest of my band with it.
                                It has a ton of low end and a very descriptive EQ section.
                                Of note is the internal DDT compression circuit, which, as I understand it, helps to minimize harsh clipping that can damage speakers.
                                I'm trying to sell this amp, because I practically got it for free, it's too heavy, and I'm not actually a fan of the DDT compression,
                                as it makes my distortion pedals sound rather lifeless.

                                This is the first real bass head I ever bought. It's a basic, powerful, and clean sounding solid state amp.
                                I unfortunately have a hard time getting it to cut through in a live setting, despite it's 450 watts.
                                It doesn't have a lot of character, but it's very easy to transport,
                                and I might use it with my synthesizer when I decide to learn how to use my synthesizer.

                                This amp was hand-built by a guy in Murphysboro, IL. It's a clone of a 200W Orange amplifier, the AD200B.
                                Those Orange amps are very expensive, but I bought this clone for half the price. Good job, me.
                                It sounds great. It's very straightforward to use, and it works exceptionally well with my pedals.
                                It has four Electro-Harmonix 6550 tubes, but I suspect it will sound better/louder when I get around to having it retubed.

                                Surprise: another Peavey product! Old Peavey stuff is so cheap.
                                I got this as a package deal with the Peavey MAX Bass head.
                                I found it locally, after looking for this particular model for what felt like a year.
                                I became interested in finding one when I heard it's one of the best sounding 2x15" SPEAKER CABINETS for the money.
                                It's somewhat rare, and it's different from a regular Peavey 215 in that it's shorter, fatter, and vented along the side.
                                It sounds significantly different from my 8x10" cabinet, which is enough justification for me to own one.
                                Not only that, it's smaller; I put some skateboard trucks and recessed handles on it to make it nice and portable.

                                There isn't much to say about the Ampeg 810.
                                They're big 140 lb fridges with eight 10" speakers, and they're an industry standard for live bassists.
                                They can handle powerful amps (up to 800W) and withstand a lot of physical abuse.
                                I also put skateboard trucks on mine so I can wheel it around without issues.
